# 0x15. API - My Journey into the World of APIs and Python Scripting

## Background Context

Hey there! As someone who's been around the block with old-school system administration, I can tell you that Bash has been the go-to for building scripts. But let me tell you, while Bash is great for a lot of things, it can get messy real quick, especially when you're dealing with complex tasks.

Enter the new generation of system administrators, commonly known as SREs (Site Reliability Engineers). We're pretty much like regular software engineers, but our playground is managing systems. And guess what? We know more than just Bash scripting.

## Why Not Bash?

So, you might be wondering, "What's wrong with Bash?" Well, nothing inherently, but there are tasks that Bash just isn't cut out for. For instance, accessing and organizing employee data via an API. That's where Python comes in, and that's exactly what I'm going to do in this project.

## What's an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a way to expose an application and its data, often serving as the public face of websites and micro-services. It allows outsiders like us to interact with the dataâ€”both accessing and modifying it.

## REST API and Microservices

Now, let's talk about REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it's an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. Microservices, on the other hand, are a method of developing software systems that are made up of independently deployable, modular services.

## Data Formats: CSV and JSON

In this project, I'll be dealing with two types of data formats: CSV (Comma Separated Values) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Both are widely used for storing data but in different ways and for different purposes.

## Pythonic Style Guide

Oh, and before I forget, having clean, readable code is super important in the industry. That's why I'll be following PEP8, the Python style guide, throughout this project. This covers everything from how to name packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, to constants.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I'll be able to explain:

- Why Bash scripting has its limitations
- What an API is and how it works
- The ins and outs of REST API
- The concept of microservices
- How to work with CSV and JSON formats
- And of course, the Pythonic way of naming things, be it packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, or constants.

So, let's dive in and start scripting the Pythonic way!
