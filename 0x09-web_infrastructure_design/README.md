# Web Infrastructure Design Project

In this project, I'm diving deep into the world of web technologies, DevOps, and system administration to create a robust and scalable web infrastructure. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of various concepts and technologies.

## Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I've delved into several essential concepts:

- **DNS:** I've learned about the Domain Name System, which acts like the internet's address book, translating domain names into IP addresses.

- **Monitoring:** I've discovered the importance of keeping a watchful eye on systems and applications to ensure smooth operations.

- **Web Server:** I now understand how web servers deliver web content to users' browsers, handling incoming requests.

- **Network Basics:** I've grasped the foundational elements of data communication on a network, including protocols and IP addressing.

- **Load Balancer:** I've explored load balancers, which distribute web traffic across servers to prevent overload.

- **Server:** I've learned about servers as computers that provide services and resources to other devices over a network.

And more!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I'm striving to achieve the following:

- **Creating a Diagram:** I'll be able to draw a diagram depicting the web stack I've built during my journey through the DevOps and SysAdmin tracks.

- **Explaining Components:** I'm working on explaining what each component in my web infrastructure does, from web servers to load balancers.

- **Understanding System Redundancy:** I'm gaining insight into the significance of system redundancy to ensure continuous availability.

- **Mastering Acronyms:** I'm becoming familiar with acronyms like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), SPOF (Single Point of Failure), and QPS (Queries Per Second).

This README.md is a snapshot of my progress in the project. As I continue learning, I'll be able to confidently navigate web infrastructure design, DevOps, and SysAdmin topics. This project is about more than just technology â€“ it's about building a solid foundation in the world of web development and contributing positively to the global community of developers.
