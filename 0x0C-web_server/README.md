# 0x0C. Web server

In this project, I've had the opportunity to dive into the world of web servers, and I've learned a lot about their essential components and functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I've become proficient in explaining the following concepts without relying on external resources like Google:

### General

- **The Role of a Web Server**: I now understand the primary role of a web server and how it serves web content to clients, facilitating the delivery of web pages and applications.

- **Child Processes**: I've grasped the concept of child processes within a web server and their significance in handling client requests efficiently.

- **Parent and Child Processes**: I can explain why web servers typically have both parent and child processes, highlighting their roles in managing incoming connections.

- **HTTP Requests**: I've become familiar with the main HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more, and how they are used to interact with web servers.

### DNS (Domain Name System)

- **DNS Basics**: I've learned what DNS stands for (Domain Name System) and its vital role in translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling us to access websites.

- **DNS Record Types**: I can differentiate between various DNS record types, including A (Address), CNAME (Canonical Name), TXT (Text), and MX (Mail Exchanger), and understand their specific purposes in DNS configurations.
