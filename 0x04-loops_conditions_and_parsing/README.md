0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing: Learning Objectives
In this project, I learned various concepts related to loops, conditions, and parsing in bash scripting. Here are the main learning objectives:

1. Creating SSH Keys
I learned how to create SSH keys, which are used for secure communication between systems. SSH keys are essential for authentication and secure access to remote servers.

2. Advantages of #!/usr/bin/env bash
I explored the advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of #!/bin/bash at the beginning of bash scripts. The former allows for better portability, as it locates the bash interpreter dynamically in the system's PATH.

3. Working with Loops
I gained a solid understanding of different loop types in bash:

while loop: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true.
until loop: Similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed until the condition becomes true.
for loop: Used to iterate over a list of items and execute a block of code for each item.
4. Conditional Statements
I learned how to use various conditional statements to make decisions in bash scripts:

if, else, elif: These statements are used to conditionally execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.
case: The case statement allows selecting from multiple conditions using pattern matching.
5. Using the cut Command
I became familiar with the cut command, which is used to extract specific fields or columns from a text file or input stream based on a delimiter.

6. Files and Comparison Operators
I learned about files and comparison operators in bash, which are used for comparing values, testing conditions, and making decisions based on the results.

Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of bash scripting fundamentals, enabling me to write more efficient and effective scripts for various automation tasks and system management.
