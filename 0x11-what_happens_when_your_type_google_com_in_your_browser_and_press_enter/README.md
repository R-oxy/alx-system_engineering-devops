# What Happens When You Type google.com and Press Enter?

## Background Context

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, I find it crucial to understand how the entire stack works, from the front-end all the way to the back-end, including the underlying infrastructure. This project serves as an exploration into what exactly happens when you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter. It's a journey that takes us through DNS resolution, TCP/IP, HTTP requests, and much more.

## Introduction

When you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter, it seems like magic when the Google homepage appears. But there's a lot going on behind the scenes. This project aims to demystify that process.

## DNS Resolution

The journey starts with converting the human-friendly domain name "google.com" into an IP address that machines can understand. This is done through DNS (Domain Name System).

## TCP/IP Connection

Once we have the IP address, the next step is to establish a TCP/IP connection between your computer and Google's server.

## HTTP Request and Response

After the connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP GET request to Google's server, which then responds with the HTML content of the webpage.

## Rendering the Webpage

The browser takes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files sent by the server and renders the Google homepage on your screen.

## Conclusion

Understanding this flow is essential for anyone involved in web development. It gives you a holistic view of how the internet works and makes you a better developer.
