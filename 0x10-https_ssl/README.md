# HTTPS SSL

In this project, I will delve into the concepts of HTTPS SSL, DNS, and web stack debugging to understand the importance of securing website traffic. Let's explore the key concepts and objectives for this project.

## Concepts

### DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is a fundamental component of the internet that translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites by name rather than remembering numeric IP addresses.

### Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves troubleshooting and resolving issues within the various components of a web server stack, which includes the web server software, application server, and database.

## Background Context

Have you ever wondered what happens when you don't secure your website traffic? In this project, we will explore the significance of securing web traffic and how HTTPS SSL plays a crucial role in ensuring data privacy and security.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to have a clear understanding of the following concepts:

### General
- What are HTTPS and SSL, and what are their two main roles?
- What is the purpose of encrypting web traffic?
- What does SSL termination mean, and why is it significant for web server configurations?

Through this project, I will gain insights into the importance of securing web traffic and the role of SSL encryption in achieving this goal.
