# 0x16. API advanced

This project is all about gaining hands-on experience with API calls and data manipulation using the Reddit API. Throughout this project, I have explored and utilized various aspects of the API to achieve the following learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

### General

- **Reading API Documentation**: I've learned how to navigate and interpret API documentation to find the specific endpoints and data I need.

- **Pagination**: Understanding how to work with pagination is crucial for handling large datasets. I've practiced making requests to endpoints with pagination.

- **JSON Data Parsing**: I've honed my skills in parsing JSON data obtained from the API responses. This includes extracting the information I need efficiently.

- **Recursive API Calls**: Making recursive calls to an API is an essential skill for dealing with more complex tasks. I've practiced this to handle multi-layered data.

- **Sorting Dictionaries**: I've learned how to sort dictionaries based on their values. This is valuable for presenting data in a structured manner.

The knowledge gained from this project will not only help me during technical interviews but also in real-world scenarios where API integration is essential. By completing the tasks in this project, I've improved my understanding of how to work with APIs and handle the data they provide.
