# Networking Basics #0

In this project, I learned about various fundamental concepts related to networking. Here are the key topics covered:

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. It is organized as follows:

1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with physical connections, cables, and hardware.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages data frames and provides error detection and correction.
3. **Network Layer**: Handles routing and logical addressing (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP) or connectionless service (UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to end-users and applications.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is a network that connects devices in a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. It is typically used for local data sharing, printer access, and internet connectivity within the confined space.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network that spans large geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs and devices across cities, countries, or continents. It enables long-distance communication and data exchange between distant locations.

## Internet

The Internet is a vast global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows users to access and exchange information worldwide.

## IP Address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It identifies the device's location and facilitates communication within the network.

## Types of IP Addresses

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (32-bit address) and IPv6 (128-bit address). IPv4 is the older version, while IPv6 was introduced to overcome the limitations of IPv4, such as the depletion of available addresses.

## Localhost

Localhost (127.0.0.1) is a special IP address that refers to the current device or computer itself. It is used to test network communication on the local machine.

## Subnet

A subnet is a division of an IP network that allows efficient management and optimization of IP addresses within a network.

## TCP/UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two data transfer protocols operating at the transport layer of the OSI model.

## Difference between TCP and UDP

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data transfer with error-checking and retransmission of lost data. UDP, on the other hand, is connectionless and offers faster but less reliable data transfer.

## Port

A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system. It enables multiple processes to use the same network interface to communicate with the network.

## SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers

- SSH: Port 22
- HTTP: Port 80
- HTTPS: Port 443

## Network Connectivity Check

To check if a device is connected to a network, a common tool or protocol is used, such as the "ping" command or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

By mastering these networking basics, I am better equipped to understand and work with computer networks and internet-based communication systems.
