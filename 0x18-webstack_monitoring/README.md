# Webstack Monitoring

In this project, I will delve into the world of web stack monitoring, where the objective is to measure and track the performance and behavior of our software systems and servers. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of managing and maintaining the reliability of web applications, allowing us to identify issues promptly, improve efficiency, and ensure optimal performance. This README will cover the background context, resources, and learning objectives related to web stack monitoring.

## Background Context

As technology advances and becomes an integral part of our lives, the saying "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure" holds more truth than ever. Monitoring our software systems is essential for various reasons, such as:

1. Identifying and mitigating potential issues before they impact users.
2. Ensuring the efficient and expected behavior of our applications.
3. Collecting data and insights to optimize and enhance our systems.

Web stack monitoring primarily falls into two main categories:

### 1. Application Monitoring
   Application monitoring focuses on gathering data about the performance and behavior of our running software. It ensures that our applications operate as expected and helps identify areas for improvement. This type of monitoring typically involves tracking response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

### 2. Server Monitoring
   Server monitoring deals with collecting data about the physical or virtual servers hosting our applications. It aims to ensure that servers are not overloaded or experiencing issues, such as CPU, memory, disk, or network overloads. Server monitoring helps maintain server health and reliability.

- [Nginx Logging and Monitoring](https://www.nginx.com/blog/logging-and-monitoring-with-nginx-and-nginx-plus/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

- The significance of monitoring in maintaining and improving system reliability.
- The two main areas of web stack monitoring: application monitoring and server monitoring.
- The purpose of access logs for a web server (e.g., Nginx) and how they are used.
- The role of error logs for a web server (e.g., Nginx) in diagnosing issues and troubleshooting problems.

Understanding and applying these concepts is crucial for effectively managing and optimizing web applications and servers.
