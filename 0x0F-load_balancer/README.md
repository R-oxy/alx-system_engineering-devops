# 0x0F. Load balancer

In this project, I'll be working on improving my web stack by introducing redundancy for my web servers. The goal is to enhance my infrastructure to handle more traffic and increase its reliability.

## Introduction

With the addition of the new servers, I aim to achieve redundancy in my web servers. This means that even if one web server fails, I will have a backup server to handle incoming requests. To accomplish this, I will be writing Bash scripts to automate the configuration of a brand new Ubuntu server according to the project's requirements.
