# Networking Basics #1: Learning Objectives

In this project, I learned various fundamental concepts related to networking:

## General

1. **localhost/127.0.0.1:** This refers to the loopback address of the local machine. It allows a computer to send network packets to itself, allowing applications to communicate with the network stack without using an external network.

2. **0.0.0.0:** This is a special IPv4 address that represents all available network interfaces on the local machine. When a service or application is bound to this address, it listens on all available network interfaces.

3. **/etc/hosts:** This is a system configuration file present in Unix-based systems (such as Linux) that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is used to override the DNS (Domain Name System) resolution for specific hosts.

4. **Displaying Active Network Interfaces:** I learned how to view the active network interfaces on my machine. This allows me to see the various network connections and their configurations.

With this knowledge, I can better understand the networking fundamentals and how different components work together to enable communication between devices on a network.
