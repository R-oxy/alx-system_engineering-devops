# 0x1A. Application server

## Background Context

In the realm of web infrastructure, the focus now shifts to enhancing the capabilities of our existing web server, Nginx. While Nginx excels at serving static content, dynamic content requires the intervention of an application server. This project introduces the integration of an application server into our infrastructure, linking it with Nginx to efficiently serve the dynamic content of our Airbnb clone project.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understanding Application vs Web Server:**
   - Distinguish the roles of web servers and application servers.
   - Recognize the need for an application server to handle dynamic content.

2. **Utilizing Gunicorn and Nginx:**
   - Learn how to deploy a Flask application using Gunicorn.
   - Integrate Gunicorn with Nginx to achieve a robust web infrastructure.

3. **Managing Routes and Strict Slashes:**
   - Explore the nuances of handling routes in Flask, paying attention to strict_slashes.

4. **Upstart for Process Management:**
   - Gain proficiency in using Upstart for managing and monitoring processes.

## Conclusion

As we delve into the intricacies of application servers, Gunicorn, and Nginx integration, this project paves the way for a more comprehensive web infrastructure. By mastering these concepts, we aim to elevate our ability to deploy and manage dynamic web applications effectively. The learning experience gained from this endeavor contributes to a deeper understanding of web stack components and their collaborative roles. Let's embark on this journey of enhancing our Airbnb clone project!
