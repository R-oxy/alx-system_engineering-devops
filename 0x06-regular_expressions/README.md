# 0x06. Regular expression: Background Context

In this project, I will be working on building regular expressions using Oniguruma, which is a regular expression library commonly used by Ruby. It's important to note that other regular expression libraries may have different properties, so it's crucial to use the specific syntax and features of Oniguruma for this project.

Regular expressions are powerful tools that allow us to search, match, and manipulate text based on specific patterns. They are widely used in programming and text processing tasks to perform complex string matching and extraction operations.

Throughout this project, I will be working with various examples and tasks that involve creating regular expressions to match specific patterns in strings. I will explore different metacharacters, quantifiers, character classes, and more to build robust and efficient regular expressions.

By the end of this project, I expect to have a solid understanding of how to use regular expressions effectively with Oniguruma, empowering me to tackle various text processing challenges in my future endeavors as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
